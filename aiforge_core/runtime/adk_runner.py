"""Production ticket processor — single-shot ADK pipeline driver.

Polls Postgres for a ``todo`` ticket via
:func:`aiforge_core.tickets.store.claim_next_any`, runs one pass of the
v6 SequentialAgent (see :mod:`pipeline`), then exits. systemd
``Restart=always RestartSec=10`` keeps the loop polling.

Heavy lifting lives in sibling modules so this file stays a thin
orchestrator:

* :mod:`pipeline`     — agent factory + EscalatingLlm wiring
* :mod:`memory_block` — pre-flight AiForgeMemory recall
* :mod:`git_pr`       — auto-commit + push + open-PR helper
* :mod:`prompts`      — per-archetype instruction strings
* :mod:`doer_tools`   — file_read / file_write / run_shell / …
